app.py to app5.py contain hugging face implementations

Notes: Doesn't access Hugging face "wiki-dpr" dataset because of a custom code issue. Argument to enable it to run is present in the code, but issue persists.


app6.py contains DialoGPT implementation

Notes: Model trained on Reddit comments. Erratic behavior, sly personality that breaks a person more than it helps.


app7.py to app11.py contain 

Notes: Hardcoded and doesn't use Machine learning concepts. Code works but "experimental_rerun" and lookup issues sometimes, that fix after manually rerunning the app from the website (3 dot menu on top right)


app12.py

Notes: Most complete version based on iteration 7-11, but "experimental_rerun" persists despite updated streamlit library. Fixes itself on manual rerun (type R) or using any other interactive elements present in the app.
